In this assignment, you will implement a number of search algorithms to solve the 3‐digit puzzle.
Given are two 3‐digit numbers called 􏰀 (start) and 􏰁 (goal) and also a set of 3‐digit numbers called 􏰂􏰃􏰄􏰅􏰆􏰇􏰇􏰈􏰉. To solve the puzzle, we want to get from 􏰀 to 􏰁 in the smallest number of moves. A move is a transformation of one number into another number by adding or subtracting 1 to one of its digits. For example, a move can take you from 123 to 124 by adding 1 to the last digit or from 953 to 853 by subtracting 1 from the first digit. Moves must satisfy the following constraints:
1. You cannot add to the digit 9 or subtract from the digit 0;
2. You cannot make a move that transforms the current number into one of the forbidden
numbers;
3. You cannot change the same digit twice in two successive moves.
